"Your program just saved the day for me!
 I tried to use AWDFLASH.exe to flash my new Shuttle HOT-603 v2.0(AMD640)
 with the new 603WWQ07.bin BIOS and it did! The only problem was that the
 BIN file wasn't complete.
 Evidently this destroyed the boot block too. I tried to restore the old
 BIOS to that EEPROM on a HOT-565(430TX) with all the other flash
 programs I could get my hands on to no avail. I was able to flash the
 HOT-603's EEPROM to 565WIQ0E.bin and it worked just fine on the HOT-565
 so I knew the chip it's self was still good. I finally gave up and
 ordered a replacement chip this morning. This evening while surfing I
 saw a  reference to you'r program on http://ping.be and downloaded it.
 With the 'Expert' mode I was able to properly flash the Winbond
 W29EE011-15 chip on the HOT-565 for the HOT-603."

1.0            UniFlash? UNIFLASH??? What the HELL is it ??!!!
--------------------------------------------------------------

UniFlash is a flash program, used to write a new BIOS on your FLASH ROM Chip.
What's new there? , you may ask, there are already programs like this on
InterNet made by BIG BRANDS like AMI, AWARD or MR. Well... there is only a
little difference: COMPLETE, WORKING SOURCE CODE IN PASCAL IS GIVEN FOR FREE!!

UniFlash is made to be universal - this can be useful when you're hot-flashing
your bios in another motherboard.

Another thing: this flasher is mainly destinated for fearless people and
experienced users. If it's your first adventure with flashing your BIOS, we
recommend you strongly using these brand flashers. You'll have to understand
we are just experienced computer users/programmers and we haven't materially
the possibility to test every routine and chips we haven't. That's the main
reason we release it. We hope people may help us in debugging and testing
routines.
NOTE by PvL: Brand name flashers have a tendency to be unstable (this is
             especially true for AWDFLASH, which f*cked up my BIOS twice
             so far, leaving me no other choice than to hot-flash) so if
             you happen to be the lucky owner of one of the TESTED flash
             chips I can really recommend using UNIFLASH instead ...


2.0            What hardware do I need for UniFlash ?
-----------------------------------------------------

Here's the minimum configuration you need to run UniFlash:
       -At least a 386 (The whole thing works in flat real mode)
       -MS DOS 4.0 and higher
       -A well known flash rom chip (SST,WinBond,Atmel,Intel,...)
       -Supported chipset

Here's a list of chipsets suported or going to be supported by Uniflash:

            | (which is a remarked |
            |  Apollo VP2)         |
            | Apollo MVP4          | <- Support for newer VIA chipsets in
            | Apollo Pro           |    version 1.20 (they're all untested)
            | Apollo Pro Plus/133  |
            | Apollo Pro 133A      | There may be problems with chipsets
            | Apollo ProMedia      | using VT8233 south bridge because I
            | Apollo Pro 133Z/PM133| don't have full data sheet for this chip.
            | Apollo KX133         | (KT266 and Pro 266)
            | Apollo KT133(A)      | These North Bridges are detected, but
            | Apollo KT266         | aren't used in any VIA's chipset (??):
            | Apollo Pro 266       | VT8653, VT8662, VT8615, VT8361, VT3133
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
AMD         | AMD 640 (remarked    | Works just fine
            | Apollo VP2)          |
            | AMD 750              | UniFlash supports true AMD chipsets since
            | AMD 760              | version 1.20. Their registers are very
            | AMD 760MP            | similar to VIA. All are untested.
            |                      | AMD 760 should work with both VIA and
            |                      | AMD south bridges.

            | 501/5101/5501        |
            | 5511                 | These chipsets are really crappy - to
            | 5571                 | support 12 chipsets, I needed to write
            | 5591/5592            | 5 different methods of enabling Flash ROM
            | 5596                 | write access. (The more code, the more
            | 5597/5598/5581/5120  | bugs :-)
            | 530                  | All SiS South Bridges have the same
            | 540                  | device ID $0008 (SiS 540 and 630 can have
            | 600                  | either $0008 or $0018 - it can be
            | 620                  | configured(!!!) through registers.
            | 630                  | Everything untested...
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
ALi         | Alladin Pro II       | I got M1543C datasheets from ALi, so
            | (M1621+M1543C)       | this one is supported now. All chipsets
            |                      | with M1543 south bridge should work,
            |                      | but they aren't identified for now.
            |                      | Alladin Pro II was tested and works OK.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
SMSC        | VictoryBX-66         | i82443BX North Bridge with SMSC SLC90E66
            |                      | South Bridge (UDMA-66 support)
            |                      | Untested.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Winbond/    | W83C553F South Bridge| I don't know if this one was ever used.
Symphony    |                      | (No known chipset with this SB)
Labs        |                      | Untested, of course.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
ITE         | IT8871F/2F and       | Don't know where used, untested.
            | IT8888F South Bridges| (No known chipset with these SBs)

PC100 BXCel is relabelled ALi Alladin Pro II on PC Chips M726 motherboard.

NEW!: The version 1.16d+ includes support for AMI's Flash Interface. It
allows you to flash even if you have an unknown chipset (new AMI WinBIOS is
necessary to use this feature). Uniflash will automatically try to use
this feature if there's no chipset detected. You can force using this mode,
even if your chipset is recognised by giving the -AMI parameter.

WARNING: AMI Flash interface doesn't work on some PC Chips boards. This can
cause UniFlash to hang at startup, when no known chipset is found (or when you
use -AMI parameter on PC Chips M726). No data will be corrupted, you just need
to push RESET button.



3.0            What flash chips are supported by UniFlash ?
-----------------------------------------------------------

UniFlash supports the following flash chips:
(* means tested and functional,
 # means tested, but doesn't work the way it should,
 ? means not tested at all (note that a lot of chips are very similar
to one another though, so if one of them works then the rest should work
fine too))

4.0            Help! I don't understand the sources !!!
-------------------------------------------------------

If you have problems understanding something mail us (address at the end).
Have a look also on the ADDCHIP.FAQ file. It explains how to add new chips
plus some details.


5.0            Expert mode
--------------------------

We included something called expert mode. If you're just a user don't enter
it (unless you have to ...).  The expert mode adds some new functions that
allow you to overwrite the bootblock (which is not normally possible) -
plus some other advanced fuctions.
To enter expert mode type "uniflash /EXPERT".
NOTE: Sometimes it may actually be NECESSARY to overwrite the bootblock because
      one BIOS mfg's bootblock may very well be incompatible with another
      BIOS mfg's BIOS ! (this is usually the case when you get a 'BOOTBLOCK
      MISMATCH' error message ...)

5.1            Making an emergency disk
---------------------------------------

It is always nice to have an emergency disk handy in case something goes
wrong. You see, most flash BIOS's incorporate something called a 'boot block'
and UNIFLASH will not normally overwrite it so it remains intact.
The boot block contains just enough code to boot up your computer with basic
peripheral support to enable you to flash in a working BIOS in case something
went wrong.

To make an emergency disk one would do the following:
-make a *DOS* system disk (NOT Win'95) using "format a: /S"
-copy uniflash to that disk
-copy a working bios image (preferably a backup that was made while the system
 was still a-ok) to the disk
-make an AUTOEXEC.BAT containing:
@UNIFLASH -E <name of BIOS image file>

(NOTE: Whatever you do, do *NOT* load HIMEM.SYS. The boot block lacks support
       routines that HIMEM.SYS requires, resulting in very nice crashes.
       And I know from experience ... !! In general, keep the boot disk as
       clean as possible (just the way it is after "format a: /S")            )

Make sure UNIFLASH and the BIOS image are on the disk as the boot block only
supports the floppy drive, you won't be able to access any harddrive !!
When you boot from this emergency disk the working BIOS image will
automatically (without any intervention by you) be flashed into the flash ROM
by UNIFLASH. This is very convenient as the boot block has no support for PCI
or AGP video cards, so you won't be able to SEE anything in the process unless
you replace your PCI videocard with an old ISA one (hint!).
UNIFLASH will give you some audible feedback, though:

first short beep: UNIFLASH invoked, reading BIOS image
second short beep: done reading BIOS image, starting to flash
double short beep: done flashing, reset your system
long continuous beep: some error occured, press any key to retry operation


6.0            How to support UniFlash?
---------------------------------------

If you want to help us in adding support for new chips, in testing the whole
thing or bugfixing, mail us BOTH!!, we'll put your name in credits at the end.
We want your opinions & experiences to make flashing BIOS an easy and safe
operation, where you doesn't need tons of flashers (if you multiply the
number of chipsets by the number of flash rom memories available, you'll
understand better what we're talking about).

7.0            Credits
---------------------------------------

Ondrej Zary (Rainbow Software) - Continues to develop this program after the
authors (below) stopped the development. Done all that is new after v1.17b.

Pascal van Leeuwen - Made first design, chipset handling routines, a primitive
write function for SST, WINBOND and INTEL, added flat real mode, etc...
Improved SST & Winbond routines, made AMD routines work, added Atmel support,
added lots & lots of flash chips (of which most are currently untested ...)
Added reliability improvements (backup of old BIOS, verify after write)
Tested both Winbond & SST chips, became an expert at hot-flashing ;-)

Galkowski Adam - Initiated the UniFlash project, made modular structure, made
the current design, added functions handling DMI, PnP and bootblock, added
expert mode, made the previous crappy AMD support, wrote this doc, tested SST
routines, had multiple rendez-vous with "Award BootBlock BIOS",
advertised, etc...

9.0            Revision info
----------------------------
1.21           -added support for SiS chipsets: 85C496+497, 85C501/5101/5501,
                5511, 5571,5591/5592, 5596, 5597/5598/5581/5120, 530, 540,
                600, 620 and 630 (all untested). It's unbelievable, but they
                are using 5 (!) different methods to enable Flash ROM write
                and what's more, all their south bridges have the same device
                ID - $0008 (SiS 540 and 630 can have either $0008 or $0018).
               -added support for SMSC VictoryBX-66 chipset
               -added support for Winbond/Symphony Labs W83C553F South Bridge
               -added support for ITE South Bridges IT8871F/2F and IT8888F
               -fixed Flash ROM detection - Device IDs can have even parity
               -changed sector structure array - can now hold more sectors
                (upto 5*65535), 128b to 8MB each (see addchip.faq)
               -added support for Alliance Semiconductor Flash ROMs:
                AS29F040, AS29F002T, AS29F002B, AS29LV400T, AS29LV400B,
                AS29F200T, AS29F200B, AS29LV800T and AS29LV800B
               -added some AMD Flash ROMs: Am29LV001BT, Am29LV001BB,
                Am29LV010B, Am29F004BT, Am29F004BB, Am29LV040B, Am29LV081B,
                Am29LV008(B)T, Am29LV008(B)B, Am29LV800BT, Am29LV800BB,

                may not work because I don't have datasheets).
                Plus some north bridges that aren't used anywhere (but are in
                VIA's INF file) - VT8653, VT8662, VT8615, VT8361, VT3133.
               -added support for AMD 750, 760 and 760MP chipsets (751,761 and
                762 north bridges, 756 and 766 south bridges). Registers are

               -fixed ALi chipset detection
               -M1543 now support 512KB ROMs, but only some revisions of
                this chip can really support them (and according to ALi, there
                is no software way to detect that)
1.18           -I (Rainbow Software) am continuing the development of this
                program after it was abandoned for two years
               -added support for i440BX/ZX and i440GX chipsets
               -added support for ALi M1543 south bridge and ALi M1621 north
                bridge (ALi Alladin Pro II chipset)
               -added some info about ASD chips into this DOC

1.17b          -fixed a bug in the -FORCE option, should work now

               -still having trouble correctly detecting flash chips,
                we can use all the input we can get on which chips are
                and aren't correctly identified by UNIFLASH !
1.17           -pre-1.20 release because of some important fixes,
                still working on some things we promised for 1.20, though
               -fixed flashing problems with Macronix & AMD chips
               -Integrated English & French version into one executable
                to avoid having to keep 2 versions synchronized
               -Cleaned up chipset detection
               -known bugs: chip detection still not 100% accurate
                (we're working on it, this will be fixed in v1.20)
1.16d          -Added AMI Flash Interface support
               -Added the "Additional BIOS Info" option
               -Added the Macronix MXIC 28F1000PPC/12V chip
               (not officially released by Adam's request)
1.16c          -Made the detection routine more accurate
1.16b          -Removed some (debugging?) code that messed up detection
1.16           -Fixed a stupid bug in the chip detection part, which made it
               impossible to identify Atmel chips, for example.
               -Tried to add TI chips and after long hours of work and of
               downloading datasheets figured out that TI chips are just
               "remarked" AMD & Intel chips (the same Mfg & Id numbers),
               so TI chips will be recognised as AMD or Intel ones.
               -Made the source code clearer. Wrote a FAQ explaining how
               to add your own chips.
               -Added the Intel 28F010/12V and 28F020/12V chips
               -Translation of the whole thing to french. The english 1.16
               version equals french 1.00FRENCH version
1.15           -Fixed problems with AMD flash chips
               -Added VIA 82C570 chipset support
               -Tested Intel 28F001BX-T/28F001BN-T support
               TO DO before final release of V1.15: fix extended memory
                     detection, does not work ok on a friends' system ...
1.14           -Added Macronix support
               -Added SST 28EE011 flash chip
               -Added AMD Am28F010, Am28F010A, Am28F020, Am28F020A, Am28F256
                Am28F256A, Am28F512 and Am28F512A flash chips
               -Removed valid PCI ROM check so it is possible to flash a
                ROM on a PCI card that does not (yet) contain a valid ROM
               -Added some safety stuff:
                -cache disabled during flashing (having the cache enabled
                 seems to be a problem with some Cyrix chips (or chip/chipset
                 combo's ?))
                -interrupts now fully disabled during actual communication with
                 the flash chip for increased reliability
               -added multiple flash chips/single ROM image support
                (experimental)
1.13           -Added Catalyst support
               -Added OPTi chipset support (for 82C750 'Vendetta')
               -Added Intel 28F400/28F004 flash chips
               -Completely rewrote PCI option ROM support (still experimental)
1.12           -Fixed problem ID-ing Intel chips (oops)
               -Made first attempt at supporting PCI option ROMS (experimental)
1.11           -Added Atmel support
1.1            -Fixed memory allocation bug with sectored (Intel,AMD) flash ROM
                chips
               -Added VIA chipset support
1.0            -First public release
