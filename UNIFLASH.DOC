"Your program just saved the day for me!
 I tried to use AWDFLASH.exe to flash my new Shuttle HOT-603 v2.0(AMD640)
 with the new 603WWQ07.bin BIOS and it did! The only problem was that the
 BIN file wasn't complete.
 Evidently this destroyed the boot block too. I tried to restore the old
 BIOS to that EEPROM on a HOT-565(430TX) with all the other flash
 programs I could get my hands on to no avail. I was able to flash the
 HOT-603's EEPROM to 565WIQ0E.bin and it worked just fine on the HOT-565
 so I knew the chip it's self was still good. I finally gave up and
 ordered a replacement chip this morning. This evening while surfing I
 saw a  reference to you'r program on http://ping.be and downloaded it.
 With the 'Expert' mode I was able to properly flash the Winbond
 W29EE011-15 chip on the HOT-565 for the HOT-603."

1.0            UniFlash? UNIFLASH??? What the HELL is it ??!!!
--------------------------------------------------------------

UniFlash is a flash program, used to write a new BIOS on your FLASH ROM Chip.
What's new there? , you may ask, there are already programs like this on
Internet made by BIG BRANDS like AMI, AWARD or MR. Well... there is only a
little difference: COMPLETE, WORKING SOURCE CODE IN PASCAL IS GIVEN FOR FREE!!

UniFlash is made to be universal - this can be useful when you're hot-flashing
your bios in another motherboard.

Another thing: this flasher is mainly destinated for fearless people and
experienced users. If it's your first adventure with flashing your BIOS, we
recommend you strongly using these brand flashers. You'll have to understand
we are just experienced computer users/programmers and we haven't materially
the possibility to test every routine and chips we haven't. That's the main
reason we release it. We hope people may help us in debugging and testing
routines.
NOTE by PvL: Brand name flashers have a tendency to be unstable (this is
             especially true for AWDFLASH, which f*cked up my BIOS twice
             so far, leaving me no other choice than to hot-flash) so if
             you happen to be the lucky owner of one of the TESTED flash
             chips I can really recommend using UNIFLASH instead ...
NOTE by Rainbow:
AWDFLASH IS REALLY BAD. When I was flashing BIOS on Abit SA6R, the verify
failed. I retried flashing about 20 times, then it succeeded. But motherboard
died after reboot. Luckily, after powering down and back up, BootBlock BIOS
worked and I was able to flash the BIOS correctly from there.


2.0            What hardware do I need for UniFlash ?
-----------------------------------------------------

Here's the minimum configuration you need to run UniFlash:
       -At least a 386 (The whole thing works in flat real mode)
       -RAM at least 2 times bigger than Flash ROM size, but less than 2GB
       -MS DOS 4.0 and higher
       -Known Flash ROM chip (see section 3.0)
       -Supported chipset (see below) - note that all of them are PCI based
        or c't Flasher 8-bit ISA card

,----------------------------------------------------------------------------,
| Don't forget to disable "Flash write protect" - either in system BIOS or   |
| using a jumper on the motherboard.                                         |

If your chipset is marked BXCel, VXPro, TXPro or something like that, it's a
relabelled chipset (ALi, SiS or VIA) on a PC Chips board, with the exception
of VXPro-II which is Utron.

The version 1.16d+ includes support for AMI's Flash Interface. It allows you
to flash even if you have an unknown chipset (new AMI WinBIOS is necessary to
use this feature). Starting from version 1.24, you must force using this mode,
if you want to use it by giving the -AMI parameter. This is neccessary because
it often doesn't work and hangs, preventing users from making BIOS backup.

2.1            Support for specific boards
------------------------------------------
These boards use non-standard write protection using general purpose outputs
(GPOs) of the chipset.
They're detected by reading the BIOS ID string from the top of 4GB. This means
that the correct BIOS MUST be present in the socket when starting UniFlash or
the flashing will not work.

3.0            What flash chips are supported by UniFlash ?
-----------------------------------------------------------

UniFlash supports the following flash chips:

 unmarked chips are not tested (note that a lot of chips are very similar to
 one another though, so if one of them works then the rest should work fine
 too)

3.1            Flash ROM pinout and notes
-----------------------------------------

Some 12V Flash ROMs require 12V voltage not only to flash, but also to detect.
If you're trying to flash 12V chip, first check that you have 12V on the VPP
pin in the socket on motherboard. Flash write protect jumper usually removes
12V from this pin.
When some parts of the chip are write protected, 12V on VPP/#RESET pin will
usually allow these protected parts to be flashed (unless the chip has N in
the name - e.g. MX29F002NT - this means that RESET pin is not connected).

Be sure that Flash ROM is inserted the correct way in the socket (key on the
chip must match with key on the socket) BEFORE powering up (if you're
hot-flashing, double check chip orientation before inserting it into socket).
Inserting it wrong way will DESTROY the chip - VCC will be swapped with GND
and if there's 12V on the VPP pin, it will be connected to Q3 data pin...

Flash ROM pinout (32-pin DIP):
          _____KEY_____
    VPP -|     \_/     |- VCC     VPP = Programming voltage (12V)
    A16 -|             |- #WE     VCC = Operating voltage (5V)
    A15 -|             |- A17     GND = Ground
    A12 -|             |- A14     A0..A17 = Address input pins
     A7 -|             |- A13     Q0..Q7  = Data input/output pins
     A6 -|             |- A8      #WE = Write enable
     A5 -|             |- A9      #OE = Output enable
     A4 -|             |- A11     #CE = Chip enable
     A3 -|             |- #OE     (# means active low signal)
     A2 -|             |- A10
     A1 -|             |- #CE     Notes:
     A0 -|             |- Q7        - some chips have #RESET instead of VPP
     Q0 -|             |- Q6        - this is 256KB chip
     Q1 -|             |- Q5        - 512KB chips have A18 instead of VPP
     Q2 -|             |- Q4        - 128KB chips have NC instead of A17
    GND -|_____________|- Q3        - 64KB chips have NC instead of A17 & A16


4.0            Help! I don't understand the sources !!!
-------------------------------------------------------

If you have problems understanding something mail me (address at the end).
Have a look also on the ADDCHIP.FAQ file. It explains how to add new chips
plus some details.


5.0            ADVANCED submenu
-------------------------------

There's ADVANCED submenu in UniFlash, which contains possibly dangerous
functions. Since v1.33, flashing is done including bootblock by default. This
is less dangerous that flashing a new BIOS and leaving incompatible bootblock
from previous BIOS there. And more, the bootblock is not exactly defined
anywhere - some BIOSes might use bigger bootblock than other, which can cause
problems.

5.1            Making an emergency disk
---------------------------------------

It is always nice to have an emergency disk handy in case something goes
wrong. You see, most flash BIOS's incorporate something called a 'boot block'
and UNIFLASH will not normally overwrite it so it remains intact.
The boot block contains just enough code to boot up your computer with basic
peripheral support to enable you to flash in a working BIOS in case something
went wrong.

To make an emergency disk one would do the following:
-make a DOS (or Win95/Win98, NOT ANY OTHER) system disk using "format a: /S"
-copy uniflash to that disk
-copy a working bios image (preferably a backup that was made while the system
 was still a-ok) to the disk
-make an AUTOEXEC.BAT containing:
@UNIFLASH -E <name of BIOS image file>

NOTE: Whatever you do, do *NOT* load HIMEM.SYS. The boot block lacks support
      routines that HIMEM.SYS requires, resulting in very nice crashes.
      And I know from experience ... !! In general, keep the boot disk as
      clean as possible, remove drvspace.bin and dblspace.bin.

Make sure UNIFLASH and the BIOS image are on the disk as the boot block only
supports the floppy drive, you won't be able to access any harddrive !!
When you boot from this emergency disk the working BIOS image will
automatically (without any intervention by you) be flashed into the flash ROM
by UNIFLASH. This is very convenient as the boot block has no support for PCI
or AGP video cards, so you won't be able to SEE anything in the process unless
you replace your PCI videocard with an old ISA one (hint!). If you have
motherboard with i815(E) chipset and you're using onboard video, it will
probably not work in boot block mode (because graphics BIOS is stored in main
Flash ROM chip) - try to put an AGP card in (there are no ISA slots).

UNIFLASH will give you some audible feedback, though:
first short beep: UNIFLASH invoked, reading BIOS image
second short beep: done reading BIOS image, starting to flash
chime sound: done flashing, reset your system
long continuous beep: some error occured, press any key to retry operation

5.2            Command-line parameters
--------------------------------------
UNIFLASH [-H|-?|[-PCIROM [BUS DEV FUN]|-AMI|-BASE xxxxx|CTFLASH [xxx]]
 [-E fname][-SAVE fname|-CHIPLIST|-FORCE xxxx][-REPAIR][-LOG][-MONO]
 [-CMOSS fname][-CMOSR fname][-CMOSC]][-QUIT][-REBOOT]

-H or -?        Shows this help screen
-E fname        Flashes fname to Flash ROM with no prompts
-LOG            Enables auto-logging to UNIFLASH.LOG
-MONO           Use if you have problems with colors on monochrome monitor
-CTFLASH        Flash ROM in c't Flasher 8-bit ISA card [xxx=port]
-PCIROM         Flash ROM on a PCI card instead of system ROM
  [BUS DEV FUN] Manually specify PCI device (decimal numbers)
-AMI            Use AMI Flash Interface
-CHIPLIST       Show list of supported flash chips with their numbers
-FORCE xxxx     Force using routines for chip xxxx (4 hex digits)
-BASE xxxxx     Set ROM Base to address xxxxx (at least 5 hex digits)
-REPAIR         Repair erased chip ID (Winbond and SST chips)
-SAVE fname     Write current bios image to file fname
-CMOSS/R fname  Save/restore CMOS settings to/from file fname
-CMOSC          Clears CMOS settings
-QUIT           Quits (e.g. UNIFLASH -SAVE BACKUP.BIN -QUIT)
-REBOOT         Reboot after flashing (use together with -E)

Parameters are executed in the same order as they are entered on the command
line - so you can use e.g. "uniflash -cmoss cmos.bak -cmosc" to save CMOS
settings to file called cmos.bak and then clear the CMOS.
Some parameters can't be used together - e.g. -AMI can't be used with -PCIROM.

-E: Flashes BIOS image from file fname including bootblock without
    any user input
-LOG: Enables logging of all important events into file UNIFLASH.LOG. Use this
      when you are sending bug reports and attach this file.
-CTFLASH: Selects ROM on c't Flasher 8-bit ISA card. This card supports
          Flash ROMs up to 512KB. Port is autodetected or can be specified
          manually as optional parameter (hex 200-3FC).
-PCIROM: Selects ROM on a PCI device instead of system ROM. Works only with
         some cards. You can optionally specify the device you want to use.
         (e.g. -PCIROM 0 3 1 = BUS 0, DEVICE 3, FUNCTION 1)
-AMI: Uses interface supported by some AMI BIOSes instead of detecting the
      chipset and writing to chipset registers to disable write protection.
      (I haven't seen this working anywhere yet...)
-CHIPLIST: Displays a list of supported chips with their IDs which are needed
           for use with -FORCE parameter.
-FORCE: Disable Flash ROM autodetection and set chip type to the one specified
        by following ID (4 hex digits) - see -CHIPLIST parameter.
-BASE: Set ROM base address manually and allow running without PCI bus.
       Useful for memory-mapped flash programming cards with old systems.
-REPAIR: ID on some Winbond and SST chips can be changed which can cause the
         chip not being recognized by any software (including BIOS - AMI BIOS
         does not work in that chip, Award BIOS displays Unknown Flash Type).
         This option can change the ID on these chips. Because UniFlash does
         not know the correct ID, you must specify it using -FORCE parameter.
-SAVE: Save current BIOS to file fname.
-CMOSS: Save current CMOS settings to file fname. CMOS memory size is detected
        automatically.
-CMOSR: Restore CMOS settings from file fname. CMOS memory size is detected
        automatically.
-CMOSC: Clear CMOS memory.


6.0            How to support UniFlash?
---------------------------------------

If you want to help me in adding support for new chips, in testing the whole
thing or bugfixing, mail me, I'll put your name in credits at the end.
I want your opinions & experiences to make flashing BIOS an easy and safe
operation, where you doesn't need tons of flashers (if you multiply the
number of chipsets by the number of Flash ROM memories available, you'll
understand better what we're talking about).

           -added SiS 648, 651, 655, 733, 745, 746, 748, 755 chipsets
           -added i845E, i845G(E/L/V)/845PE, i845MP/MZ, i852GM/855GM, i855PM,
            i875P, E7205, E7501, E7505 chipsets
           -added VIA Apollo KT333, KT400(A), Apollo Pro 266T, P4X400
           -added ALi Aladdin 7, Aladdin Pro III (TNT2), CyberBLADE Aladdin i1,
            Aladdin Pro 5(T/M), Aladdin-P4, CyberAladdin-P4
           -modified multi-language code to save some memory by initializing
            only the selected language (also reduced EXE file size)
           -moved PCI card support into separate unit (PCICARDS.PAS) and added
            specific support for these PCI network cards:
             STMicroelectronics STE10/100(A), Winbond W89C840AF,
             SMSC LAN83C175 EPIC/C, VIA VT6102, VT6105M Rhine III
             Realtek RTL8129/30/39, RTL8139 series, RTL8169 series
             ADMtek AL981 Comet, AN983,985(B/BL) Centaur (B),
             ADM9511,9513 Centaur II, Adaptec AIC-6915
           -added support for PMC Pm49FL002/004/008 FWHs/LPCs
1.30       -added timeouts to all program/erase routines so there should never
            be any lockups, even if Flash ROM does not respond
           -fixed incorrect ROM Base when no Flash ROM detected
           -fixed (forced) displayed when chip was forced and then redetected
           -graph color during flashing now represents the write status -
            green means write OK, red means write failed (timeout/error)
           -fixed GenPageProg and AtmelPageProg to avoid extra retries for
            chips that do not support error bit - it slowed down flashing and
            reduced chip life (nice to see how fast W29EE011 really is)
           -added support for i82801DB ICH4
           -added a question when flashing without bootblock and there's
            bootblock mismatch allowing user to flash including bootblock
            (to prevent users from killing the BIOS because of not reading
            this manual...)
           -removed PnP (ESCD) manipulation (DMI was removed some time ago),
            it was very dangerous (no checks if there really is ESCD data -
            easy way to kill the BIOS) and useless
           -fixed a bug in -BASE parameter (thanks to Krystian Rozycki)
           -fixed bug in protect/unprotect code for all FWHs that prevented
            flashing from working
           -added nVidia nForce support
1.29       -added some Winbond Flash ROMs: W39L512, W39F010, W39L010, W39L020,
            W39L040, W39V040FA (FWH) and W49F020
           -found old Catalyst datasheets - fixed CAT28F150T, added CAT28F015T
            and CAT28F015B
           -better PCI ROM flashing, added 3Dfx Banshee support
           -added Micron Copperhead+Coppertail chipset detection (has no flash
            write protection)
           -added Contaq/Cypress hyperCache chipset (CY82C691+CY82C693(U/UB))
            and 386/486 chipsets with PCI (CY82C599 required)
           -changed i82378ZB SIO and i82379AB SIO.A detection (it has no class
            code - now detected by vendor and device ID if 82434LX/NX present)
           -fixed CMOS size detection detecting falsely 256b on some boards
           -modified code to allow easier implementation of various flash
            access methods (external progammers, PCI cards...)
           -rewrote ALi FinALi support using these new methods (it was a lot
            easier now)
           -some cosmetic fixes (misaligned error messages, some german texts)
           -fixed flashing on PC Chips M715 board (i440LX) with Award
            BootBlock BIOS (GPO used for write protection)
           -added VIA VT8235 south bridge support
           -added STMicroelectronics M50LPW040, M50FW002 and M50LPW002 chips
           -added unprotect for STMicroelectronics LPC and FWH chips
           -found a way to unprotect Flash ROM on Abit BX133-RAID (GPO used),
            might work on other Abit i440BX based boards too
            BUT: Flashing failed with Winbond W49F002U - some cache problems?
1.28       -fixed -SAVE paramter (it was completely broken)
           -display Chipset and Flash ROM when only -QUIT parameter specified
           -fixed bug causing reset of ITE LPC Super I/Os (resulting in floppy
            and COM&LPT ports not working until reboot)
           -fixed Macronix chip detection
           -fixed Atmel AT29Cxxx detection (again, it really works now)
           -fixed Atmel programming routine (chip remained unprotected)
           -fixed some SiS chipset support
           -fixed Utron 128KB support (again)
           -fixed showing SUCCESS when bootblock mismatch and user answered NO
           -fixed the detection routine erased vendor and device IDs from some
            Winbond and SST chips (detected properly once but then unknown,
            BIOS displayed "Unknown Flash Type" message)
           -added repair feature to repair the erased IDs (-repair parameter)
           -added support for ALi FinALi 486 chipset
           -enable/disable menu items after redetect with/without Flash ROM
           -verify now shows unchanged areas
           -removed $4B and $D5 IDs for Macronix MX28F1000P (they were there
            because of the detection bug which is now fixed)
           -added logging for north bridge methods
           -added support for UMC UM8881F+UM8886BF chipset (no datasheets,
            reverse engineering used)
           -fixed hang when running under Award BootBlock BIOS with
            uninitialized or absent graphics card
           -added user friendly filename editing, default file names when
            saving a file and file browser when opening a file (press ENTER on
            the prompt, TAB to change drive)
           -added I/O error checking for all file operations
           -added -REBOOT patameter to reboot after flashing using -E
           -added -BASE parameter to set ROM base address manually and allow
            UniFlash to run without PCI bus
1.27       -added -MONO parameter for monochrome monitors
           -enhanced -PCIROM functionality, you can now manually specify
            a device by its BUS, DEVICE and FUNCTION numbers (decimal)
           -fixed HiNT VXPro-II (Utron UC85C501/502) 128KB Flash ROMs
           -added some VIA chipsets: ProSavage KM133(A), P4M266, P4X266(A)/333
           -added real VIA VT8233 support
           -fixed hang when EMM386.EXE is loaded (display error message now)
           -success chime sound also in emergency mode
           -fixed Atmel AT29Cxxx detection
           -added ITE IT8700F/8705F and IT8710 LPC Super I/O detection with
            SiS 540 and SiS 630 chipsets and all newer
           -added some SiS chipsets : SiS 635, SiS 640, SiS 645, SiS 645DX,
            SiS 650, SiS 730, SiS 735 and SiS 740 - I have no datasheets, but
            SiS 735 is tested and works
           -clear keyboard buffer before asking for file names and also on exit
           -fixed memory de-allocation bug when HIMEM.SYS is loaded
1.26       -added Intel E7500 chipset with 82801CA (ICH3-S) I/O Controller Hub
           -added some ALi chipsets: Aladdin III (M1521 and M1523(B)) and
            Aladdin IV/IV+ (M1531(B))
           -ALi FINALi 486 chipset (M1489) is not supported because it doesn't
            map Flash ROM below 4GB
           -added AMD 760MPX chipset with AMD-768 South Bridge
           -added OPTi Vendetta 82C750 chipset (removed the old disabled code)
           -added HiNT VXPro-II chipset (I think that it's Utron UC85C501/502,
            because this one matches it and has programmable Mfg.&Device IDs)
           -added -QUIT parameter - quits when processed, all comands after
            will be ignored (useful use: "UNIFLASH -SAVE BACKUP.BIN -QUIT")
           -added German language support (by Gerald Bottcher)
           -PCI-to-ISA posted write buffer is disabled on ALi chipsets during
            flashing to fix problems with some Flash ROMs (e.g. EON)
           -added unprotect for SST49LF002A/003A/004A/008A FWHs
1.25       -fixed crash in Windows on some machines - display error message
            (thanks to Alejando Pelaez)
           -pressing ESC in -chiplist will quit
           -CMOS size in log
           -added -CMOSS (Save CMOS), -CMOSR (Restore CMOS) and -CMOSC (Clear
            CMOS) options (they work also in Windows)
           -added support for 256b CMOS
           -fixed CMOS support to save/restore/clear also bytes 15 and 16
           -added ServerWorks ServerSet III LE and HE chipsets with Reliance
            NB6536 & NB6635 North Bridges (without any info from ServerWorks)
           -added National Semiconductor PicoPower Vesuvius-LS chipset
           -added National Semiconductor Geode GX1 CPU with North Bridge
            (Cyrix MediaGX) and CS5530(A) South Bridge (Cyrix CX5530(A))
1.24       -added support for some ALi chipsets: Aladdin Pro IV and ALiMAGiK 1
           -fixed 256KB and 512KB support for ALi chipsets
           -added VIA Apollo VP3 with VT82C596 South Bridge
           -implemented Redetect Flash ROM function
           -AMI Flash Interface is no longer automatically enabled to prevent
            hangs. You must use "-ami" parameter to activate it.
           -added two more IDs for Macronix MX28F1000P - $4B and $D5
           -simplified detection routine - removed support for multiple Flash
            ROMs and removed all 16-bit wide ROMs, cleaned up the code
           -pressing Q in -chiplist will quit (like MORE.COM)
           -fixed Macronix MX29F002(N)T slow erase bug
           -added Reliance/ServerWorks OSB4 South Bridge
1.23       -added Italian language support (by Enrico Antongiovanni)
           -added timeout to GenPageProgB and GenPageProgW (to prevent hangs
            with boot block protection enabled on Winbond Flash ROMs)
           -added auto-logging feature (-LOG parameter)
           -added support for Intel 830MP and 845 chipsets
           -new keyboard handler doesn't use BIOS - this allows UniFlash to
            work correctly under Award BootBlock BIOS (tested)
           -added simple help on the bottom of screen in menu
           -added new program/erase routines for Winbond Sectored Flash ROMs
            (may fix Winbond W29F002U?)
           -tried to fix but still not fixed SiS 501/5101/5501 support
           -some VIA reverse engineering (reserved registers seems to be used)
            but new VIA/AMD chipsets still not working (if you have "Flash
            Write Protect" option in BIOS, your chipset will work when you
            disable it)
1.22       -added error messages: running under Windows, PCI bus not found
           -fixed Flash ROM write protect enable/disable - fixed possible
            chipset register corruption
           -added new delay routine based on Time Stamp Counter (TSC), it's
            used on all CPUs that supports TSC (Pentium+), old CPUs use the
            old routine. This fixed all problems with slow performance on
            fast computers
           -modified waiting times for Page Write Flash ROMs (most of Atmel,
            SST and Winbond Flash ROMs) to prevent lock-ups
           -fixed i430MX South Bridge detection (thanks to Josh Little but he
            paid hard for that - his notebook doesn't work anymore because
            Intel 28F004-T support doesn't work)
           -fixed a _VERY_ NASTY BUG in Bulk Erase/Need Blanking chip support
            this one was there probably from the beginning of UniFlash and
            actually caused the same byte to be flashed to entire chip...
            This fixed almost all Bulk Erase/Need Blanking chips.
           -Nils Emil P. Larsen tested these Bulk Erase/Need Blanking chips,
            they're working CAT28F010, MX28F1000P, Intel 28F010 and also H.T.
            M21561 (which is actually MX28F1000P)
           -added support for Intel 860 chipset (Xeon) and ALi Aladdin V
           -added support for 1MB Flash ROMs with VIA VT82C596(A|B) and
            VT82C686(A) South Bridges
           -doesn't exit when no Flash ROM detected in PCI Option ROM mode
           -chiplist now pauses after each screen (no need for external more
            program) but not when stdout is redirected
           -fixed memory corruption when using -chiplist (thanks to Marusceac
            Claudiu Florin)
           -beep after successful flashing
           -heavy menu modifications, removed expert and debug modes - they're
            not needed anymore, add Home,PgUp/End,PgDown keys
           -removed BIOS info (I haven't seen it working anywhere)
           -added some Intel chips: 28F008-T series and 28F008-B series
           -added STMicroelectronics Flash ROMs: M28F256, M28F512, M28F101,
            M28F102, M28F201, M29F512B, M29F010B, M29F040(B), M29F080A,
            M29F016B, M29F002(B)(N)T, M29F002(B)B, M29F100(B)T, M29F100(B)B,
            M29F200(B)T, M29F200(B)B, M29F400(B)T, M29F400(B)B, M29F800AT,
            M29F800AB, M29F160BT, M29F160BB, M29W512B, M29W010B, M29W022BT,
            M29W022BB, M29W040(B), M29W200BT, M29W200BB, M29W400(B)T,
            M29W400(B)B, M29W800(A)T, M29W800(A)B, M29W160BB/DB, M29W004(B)T,
            M29W004(B)B, M29W008(A)T, M29W008(A)B, M50FW040 (FWH),
            M50FW080 (FWH) and M50LPW080 (LPC)
           -added Texas Instruments Flash ROMs: TMS28F210, TMS29xF040 and
            info about the others into docs
           -added Fujitsu Flash ROMs: MBM29F002TC, MBM29F002BC, MBM29F200TC,
            MBM29F200BC, MBM29F400TC, MBM29F400BC, MBM29F040C, MBM29F033C,
            MBM29LV160TE, MBM29LV160BE, MBM29PL160TD and MBM29PL160BD
           -modified Mosel support for SyncMOS chips F29C31004B and F29C31400T
           -fixed a bit PCI Option ROM enabling (for AGP cards), but flashing
            still does not work (looks like writes to ROM are ignored - like
            write protection, the Flash ROM is not responding to commands)
           -simplified the detection routine (note: new one is still not done)
1.21       -added support for SiS chipsets: 85C496+497, 85C501/5101/5501,
            5511, 5571,5591/5592, 5596, 5597/5598/5581/5120, 530, 540, 600,
            620 and 630 (all untested). It's unbelievable, but they are using
            5 (!) different methods to enable Flash ROM write and what's more,
            all their south bridges have the same device ID - $0008 (SiS 540
            and 630 can have either $0008 or $0018).
           -added support for SMSC VictoryBX-66 chipset
           -added support for Winbond/Symphony Labs W83C553F South Bridge
           -added support for ITE South Bridges IT8871F/2F and IT8888F
           -fixed Flash ROM detection - Device IDs can have even parity
           -changed sector structure array - can now hold more sectors (upto
            5*65535), 128b to 8MB each (see addchip.faq)
           -added support for Alliance Semiconductor Flash ROMs: AS29F040,
            AS29F002T, AS29F002B, AS29LV400T, AS29LV400B, AS29F200T,
            AS29F200B, AS29LV800T and AS29LV800B
           -added some AMD Flash ROMs: Am29LV001BT, Am29LV001BB, Am29LV010B,

            Am29LV008(B)B, Am29LV800BT, Am29LV800BB, Am29SL800CT, Am29SL800CB,
            Am29F016(B), Am29F017B, Am29LV017B, Am29LV116BT, Am29LV116BB,
            Am29F160DT, Am29F160DB, Am29LV160BT/DT, Am29LV160BB/DB,
            Am29SL160CT, Am29SL160CB, Am29PL160CB, Am29F032B, Am29LV033C,
            Am29LV320DT, Am29LV320DB, Am29LV065D
           -added some Atmel Flash ROMs: AT29LV512, AT49x512, AT49x010,
            AT49x001(N)T, AT49x001(N), AT49x002(N)T, AT49x002(N),
            AT49x2048(A), AT49x4096(A), AT49x008AT, AT49x8192(A)T,
            AT49x8192(A), AT49x8011T, AT49x8011, AT49x160/161(4)T,
            AT49x160/161(4), AT49BV320T/321T, AT49BV320/321
           -added some Catalyst Flash ROMs: CAT28F010, CAT28F020, CAT28F102,
            CAT28F512
           -added EON Flash ROMs: EN29F040, EN29F080, EN29F800T, EN29F800B,
            EN29F002T, EN29F002B
           -added Hyundai Flash ROMs: HY29F002T, HY29F002B, HY29F040,

            A29002(1)T tested and works correctly, others are untested.
           -added support for newer VIA chipsets (all untested)
            Apollo MVP4, Apollo Pro, Apollo Pro Plus/133/133A,

            not work because I don't have datasheets).
            Plus some north bridges that aren't used anywhere (but are in
            VIA's INF file) - VT8653, VT8662, VT8615, VT8361, VT3133.
           -added support for AMD 750, 760 and 760MP chipsets (751,761 and

            with these I/O controller hubs:
            82801AA(ICH), 82801AB(ICH0), 82801BA(ICH2), 82801BAM(ICH2-M)
            (they're all not tested)
           -fixed ALi chipset detection
           -M1543 now support 512KB ROMs, but only some revisions of this chip
            can really support them (and according to ALi, there is no
            software way to detect that)
1.18       -I (Rainbow Software) am continuing the development of this program
            after it was abandoned for two years
           -added support for i440BX/ZX and i440GX chipsets
           -added support for ALi M1543 south bridge and ALi M1621 north

           -still having trouble correctly detecting flash chips, we can use
            all the input we can get on which chips are and aren't correctly
            identified by UNIFLASH !
1.17       -pre-1.20 release because of some important fixes, still working
            on some things we promised for 1.20, though
           -fixed flashing problems with Macronix & AMD chips
           -Integrated English & French version into one executable to avoid
            having to keep 2 versions synchronized
           -Cleaned up chipset detection
           -known bugs: chip detection still not 100% accurate
            (we're working on it, this will be fixed in v1.20)
1.16d      -Added AMI Flash Interface support
           -Added the "Additional BIOS Info" option
           -Added the Macronix MXIC 28F1000PPC/12V chip
            (not officially released by Adam's request)
1.16c      -Made the detection routine more accurate
1.16b      -Removed some (debugging?) code that messed up detection
1.16       -Fixed a stupid bug in the chip detection part, which made it
            impossible to identify Atmel chips, for example.
           -Tried to add TI chips and after long hours of work and of
            downloading datasheets figured out that TI chips are just
            "remarked" AMD & Intel chips (the same Mfg & Id numbers), so TI
            chips will be recognised as AMD or Intel ones.
           -Made the source code clearer. Wrote a FAQ explaining how to add
            your own chips.
           -Added the Intel 28F010/12V and 28F020/12V chips
           -Translation of the whole thing to french. The english 1.16 version
            equals french 1.00FRENCH version
1.15       -Fixed problems with AMD flash chips
           -Added VIA 82C570 chipset support
           -Tested Intel 28F001BX-T/28F001BN-T support
           TO DO before final release of V1.15: fix extended memory detection,
           does not work ok on a friends' system ...
1.14       -Added Macronix support
           -Added SST 28EE011 flash chip
           -Added AMD Am28F010, Am28F010A, Am28F020, Am28F020A, Am28F256
            Am28F256A, Am28F512 and Am28F512A flash chips
           -Removed valid PCI ROM check so it is possible to flash a ROM on a
            PCI card that does not (yet) contain a valid ROM
           -Added some safety stuff:
            -cache disabled during flashing (having the cache enabled seems to
             be a problem with some Cyrix chips (or chip/chipset combo's ?))
            -interrupts now fully disabled during actual communication with
             the flash chip for increased reliability
           -added multiple flash chips/single ROM image support (experimental)
1.13       -Added Catalyst support
           -Added OPTi chipset support (for 82C750 'Vendetta')
           -Added Intel 28F400/28F004 flash chips
           -Completely rewrote PCI option ROM support (still experimental)
1.12       -Fixed problem ID-ing Intel chips (oops)
           -Made first attempt at supporting PCI option ROMS (experimental)
1.11       -Added Atmel support
1.1        -Fixed memory allocation bug with sectored (Intel,AMD) flash ROM
            chips
           -Added VIA chipset support
1.0        -First public release


9.1            KNOWN BUGS
-------------------------
 - Intel 28F004-T doesn't work
 - PCI Option ROM Flashing (-pcirom parameter) doesn't work on many cards
 - 256KB BIOSes don't work on some i430VX/HX boards (AWDFLASH works!)
 - Some VIA and AMD chipsets don't work - maybe because of non-standard flash
   write protection on some boards.
 - Garbage on screen instead of flashing - on Asus P5A board with Aladdin V
   and 256K Flash ROM, but it works OK on Micronics C200 (same chipset and
   128K Flash ROM). On PC Partner VIB8x4DS board with VIA Apollo VPX, UniFlash
   flashes the SyncMOS F29C51002T chip OK but then hangs with garbage on
   screen. This problem appears to be associated with SyncMOS Flash ROMs only.
 - Many Abit boards do not work - looks like undocumented write protection


9.2            What's missing
-----------------------------
 - Boot Block on Winbond W29C020 can be flashed even if the Boot Block
   protection is enabled on the chip - AMIFLASH v8.15.02 can do it but
   UniFlash can't (I don't know how to do it)
 - Support for ServerWorks, UMC, new VIA and new SiS chipsets because
   datasheets are unavailable (these companies are simply ignoring e-mails)
   I can't do much with only "unofficial" info.
 - Support for some exotic Flash ROMs like Intel 82802AA 2mbit Firmware Hub or
   Bright BM29FS040 (no datasheets available)

UniFlash does NOT work on boards made by Intel. They use custom BIOS write
protection and have soldered Flash ROM chips (often in TSOP package) - so
there's nothing to hot-flash. They have recovery mode (activated by jumper)
in case something goes wrong with the BIOS.


11.0            Beta testing stuff
----------------------------------

We would like to extend our thanx to the following people who've been
very helpful with beta testing this program.
NOTE: YOU can be on this list too! All you have to do is send
information on a system where UNIFLASH doesn't work and help with
getting it to work on that system.
Please help us in making UNIFLASH the universal and reliable tool we had
in mind when we started this project. Thanx in advance!

12.0            Biz support
---------------------------

We would like to thank the following people at the various flash ROM
and chipset manufacturers for their support (in random order):

            Scotts Chen at Macronix International Co., Ltd.
            Darlene Browne at Acer Laboratories, Inc., (USA), Administrator
            Niel Smith, Application Engineering Manager, ALI USA
            Henry Ho at Macronix International Co., Ltd.
            Michael Solinas at Silicon Storage Technology, Inc. (SST), USA
            Phillip Chang at Megawin Technology Co., Ltd.
            Christopher Emerson and David Chu at Cypress Semiconductor Corp.


Thanks goes to Intel - all datasheets are freely available on their web page
upon release of new hardware. Guess why are Intel chipset the most compatible.
The companies in the list below should take this as an example of developer
support.

I would like NOT to THANK TO following COMPANIES for providing NO SUPPORT
for independent developers and NOT REPLYING TO E-MAILS:

            Silicon Integrated Systems (SiS)
            United Microelectronics Corporation (UMC)
            ServerWorks
            NVIDIA Corporation

I finally got some real e-mail from VIA, but only bad news:
"At this time, datasheets are only available to manufacturers under non
disclosure agreement who have a genuine application they are developing. This
policy is currently under review but at this time I cannot provide the
datasheets to you."
